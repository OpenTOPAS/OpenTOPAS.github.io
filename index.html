        <h3>  TOPAS user meetings </h3>
        <p> 
        Are you attending a scientific meeting and would like to have a TOPAS User Meeting? 
            Let us know and we will try to organize one, especially around PTCOG, AAPM, RRS, and FRPT meetings.


        <h3>What is OpenTOPAS ?</h3>
        <p> 
            The NIH-funded TOPAS project made radiation therapy simulations using the Monte Carlo method easily accessible 
            for the radiotherapy community. The code has been released previously as open source. This repository brings TOPAS to a new, 
            open release stage, called OpenTOPAS. <br><br>
            OpenTOPAS wraps and extends the <a href="https://geant4.web.cern.ch" target="_blank"> Geant4 Simulation Toolkit </a> 
            to provide an easier-to-use application for the medical physicist. 
            OpenTOPAS’s unique parameter control system lets you assemble and control a rich library of simulation objects (geometry components, 
            particle sources, scorers, etc.) with no need to write C++ code and without knowledge of the underlying Geant4 Simulation Toolkit. 
            Please visit our <a href="https://ucsf.box.com/s/5g6n6uvi8goljpsku3z4gi6on959w4n3" target="_blank">User guide</a> for mode details.
            <br> <br>
            OpenTOPAS basic concepts were originally created out of an NIH-funded collaboration of Massachusetts General Hospital, University 
            of California San Francisco, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for the development of the TOPAS software. The current collaboration 
            between University of California San Francisco and Massachusetts General Hospital continues to support and develop TOPAS under the name of 
            OpenTOPAS since 2024.
            <br> <br>
            OpenTOPAS is designed for simulation of medical applications of ionizing radiation with the Monte Carlo method. The free availability of OpenTOPAS 
            is intended to aid and stimulate research by medical physicists, radiobiologists, and clinicians with emphasis on all modalities of radiotherapy. 
            We recommend new users look at the key publications to explore its potential.
            <br> <br>
            OpenTOPAS is fully open-access. Advanced users remain free to implement their own simulation objects in C++ code, and add them to 
            OpenTOPAS via fork mechanism. While user-written extensions benefit from underlying functionality of OpenTOPAS base classes and 
            the OpenTOPAS parameter system, they can exploit the full flexibility of Geant4.

        <h3> Future of the TOPAS Collaboration</h3>
        <p>
            <p> The NIH-funded TOPAS team feels a need to address a recent addition to the <a href="https://www.topasmc.org/message-regarding-other-codes" target="_blank"> topasmc </a> website on May 6, 2024. This address can be found <a href="https://opentopas.github.io/news.html" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>
