        <h3> May 7, 2024: The TOPAS Collaboration.</h3>
        <p>
            <p> The NIH-funded TOPAS team feels a need to address a recent addition to the <a href="https://www.topasmc.org" target="_blank"> topasmc </a> website on May 6, 2024. </p>
            <p> While funded by NIH, the TOPAS project was first led by Dr. Paganetti (MGH) and then by Dr. Faddegon (UCSF) as 
            Principal Investigators. Both involved Mr. Perl from SLAC as a subcontractor. As Mr. Perl stated in his post from 
            May 6 on the website mentioned above, he acted as an architect of the TOPAS development for many years. We acknowledge 
            Mr. Perl's contribution as a code architect.</p>
 
            <p>The project was an institutional collaboration between MGH, SLAC, and UCSF. Code development was done jointly 
            between the site PIs at MGH (Dr. Paganetti), UCSF (Dr. Faddegon), and SLAC (Mr. Perl) with the help of many talented 
            researchers, postdocs, and students at MGH and UCSF who contributed to the code validation and developed most of the features of TOPAS.</p>
 
            <p>As the previous NCI funding period ended, we submitted a renewal application to the NCI this year. This was done by the 
            TOPAS team, not including Mr. Perl, who had decided to leave the collaboration. We, as the remaining TOPAS team, have now 
            moved to OpenTOPAS evolving from the previous TOPAS.</p>

            <p>We leave it up to the current users whether they want to use the previous TOPAS code led by Mr. Perl or follow the TOPAS 
            collaboration to OpenTOPAS.</p>

        <h3>What is OpenTOPAS ?</h3>
        <p> 
            The NIH-funded TOPAS project made radiation therapy simulations using the Monte Carlo method easily accessible 
            for the radiotherapy community. The code has been released previously as open source. This repository brings TOPAS to a new, 
            open release stage, called OpenTOPAS. <br><br>
            OpenTOPAS wraps and extends the <a href="https://geant4.web.cern.ch" target="_blank"> Geant4 Simulation Toolkit </a> 
            to provide an easier-to-use application for the medical physicist. 
            OpenTOPAS’s unique parameter control system lets you assemble and control a rich library of simulation objects (geometry components, 
            particle sources, scorers, etc.) with no need to write C++ code and without knowledge of the underlying Geant4 Simulation Toolkit. 
            Please visit our <a href="https://opentopas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">User guide</a> for mode details.
            <br> <br>
            OpenTOPAS basic concepts were originally created out of an NIH-funded collaboration of Massachusetts General Hospital, University 
            of California San Francisco, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for the development of the TOPAS software. The current collaboration 
            between University of California San Francisco and Massachusetts General Hospital continues to support and develop TOPAS under the name of 
            OpenTOPAS since 2024.
            <br> <br>
            OpenTOPAS is designed for simulation of medical applications of ionizing radiation with the Monte Carlo method. The free availability of OpenTOPAS 
            is intended to aid and stimulate research by medical physicists, radiobiologists, and clinicians with emphasis on all modalities of radiotherapy. 
            We recommend new users look at the key publications to explore its potential.
            <br> <br>
            OpenTOPAS is fully open-access. Advanced users remain free to implement their own simulation objects in C++ code, and add them to 
            OpenTOPAS via fork mechanism. While user-written extensions benefit from underlying functionality of OpenTOPAS base classes and 
            the OpenTOPAS parameter system, they can exploit the full flexibility of Geant4.
