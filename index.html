        <h3>What is OpenTOPAS ?</h3>
        <p> 
            OpenTOPAS wraps and extends the Geant4 Simulation Toolkit to provide an easier-to-use application for the medical physicist. 
            OpenTOPAS’s unique parameter control system lets you assemble and control a rich library of simulation objects (geometry components, 
            particle sources, scorers, etc.) with no need to write C++ code and without knowledge of the underlying Geant4 Simulation Toolkit. 
            Please visit our User guide for mode details.
            <br> <br>
            OpenTOPAS basic concepts were originally created out of an NIH-funded collaboration of Massachusetts General Hospital, University 
            of California San Francisco, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for the development of the TOPAS software. The current collaboration 
            between University of California San Francisco and Massachusetts General Hospital continues to support and develop TOPAS under the name of 
            OpenTOPAS since 2024.
            <br> <br>
            The applications of OpenTOPAS are extense in the field of radiation therapy research and medical physics applications. We recommend new
            users to look at the OpenTOPAS and TOPAS key publications to explore the potential of this software.
            <br> <br>
            OpenTOPAS is fully open-access. Advanced users remain free to implement their own simulation objects in C++ code, and add them to 
            OpenTOPAS via an extension mechanism. While user-written objects benefit from underlying functionality of OpenTOPAS base classes and 
            the OpenTOPAS parameter system, they can exploit the full flexibility of Geant4.
