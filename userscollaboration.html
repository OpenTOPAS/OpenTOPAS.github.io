        <p>
          We welcome user contributions and promote the proper credit. 
          If you would like to contribute to OpenTOPAS, for instance, by adding a filter, scorer, 
          geometry component, etc, please consider how your new addition would be generalized to a 
          broader community. Then, we recommend the following to keep credit for your valuable work.

        </p>
        <p> 
          As an external user of OpenTOPAS: 
          <li> Create a Fork to the OpenTOPAS repository, </li>
          <li> Perform your changes. </li>
          <li> Perform a quick qi-test to ensure your code passes the basic quality check and 
               compatibility requirements on top of GitHub code testing. </li>
          <li> Propose a Pull Request in the public GitHub repository of OpenTOPAS. </li>
        </p>   

        <p>  The pull request shall be 
          evaluated by an OpenTOPAS developer (you can choose one from the pull request webpage) to 
          perform a redundancy check and eventually integrated it into OpenTOPAS. This way, you will 
          get the proper credit for your OpenTOPAS contribution and will be reflected in your GitHub 
          history. Any change, feedback, or comment shall be posted in the proper pull request for you 
          to address before merging.
        </p>

        <p> If you have any issue with the physics, then set a simple example showing your finding. We
          will help you if that issue has to be scalated to Geant4 directly, or whether a missing Geant4
          feature must be added to OpenTOPAS.
